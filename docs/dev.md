## Bundle Implementation

A bundle contains an arbitrary set of files or directories and is a tarball of all the provided inputs along with [additional metadata](resources.md#Bundle). 

A bundle is identified by the `dev.carvel.imgpkg.bundle` [label](https://docs.docker.com/config/labels-custom-metadata/) marking the image as an imgpkg bundle in the image manifest.
